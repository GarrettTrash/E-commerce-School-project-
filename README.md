# E-commerce-School-project-
 Project carried out in collaboration with a classmate of mine. 
 She did the database part. the cart is not optimized, the session is not saved. 
 If something is added to the cart upon exiting the page, the products will not be saved.
 The code can be chaotic being one of the first "" complex "" projects.
 
 Pls dont be afraid to msg me if u want to collaborate on something. 
 (im from italy but im able to speak a bit of english)
